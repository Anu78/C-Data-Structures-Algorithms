## linked lists

A singly linked list, like the one here, is just a regular list with the exception that every element in the list has a pointer to the next element within it. You can only traverse forwards from the head.

### solution

We start from the head of list l1, and append all the nodes in that list to our output list, lout. Then, we repeat the exact same process starting from the head of list l2.
