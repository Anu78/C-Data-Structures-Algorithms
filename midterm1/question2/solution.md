## solutions

### max value
All we need to do is iterate through the entire list and keep track of the highest value throughout. When a value in the list is higher than the value we stored previously, we update the max. 

### is present?
Similar approach. We iterate through each value in the linked list and check if it matches the value we're looking for.
