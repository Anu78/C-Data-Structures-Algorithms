Say we start with the string "racecar".

Our function compares the first and last character, "r" and "r".

Then we increase the left pointer and decrease the right pointer. Now we're comparing "a" and "a".

Eventually, if all the characters match, the left pointer will equal the right pointer, meaning we've gone through the whole string and determined that it is a palindrome.
